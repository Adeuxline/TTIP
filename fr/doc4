[US: Article X.7: Technological Neutrality
1. No Party may prevent a supplier of telecommunications services from choosing the technologies
it desires to use to supply its services subject to requirements necessary to satisfy legitimate public
policy interests, provided that any measure restricting such choice is not prepared, adopted, or
applied in a manner that creates unnecessary obstacles to trade.
2. If a Party adopts a measure that mandates the use of a specific technology or standard, or
otherwise limits a supplier's ability to choose the technology it uses to supply a service, it shall do
so on the basis of:
(a) legislation; or
(b) a rulemaking
in which the Party determines that market forces have not achieved, or could not reasonably be
expected to achieve, its legitimate public policy objective.]
