request. Obligations shall not be suspended until the original panel has notified its ruling,
and any suspension shall be consistent with the panel ruling.

temporary and shall not be applied after:
  1. the Parties have reached a mutually agreed solution pursuant to Article 17; or
  2. the Parties have agreed that the measure notified under Article 12 paragraph 1 brings the
Party complained against into conformity with the provisions referred to in Article 2; or

negotiations with the complaining Party to develop mutually acceptable compensation
within 14 days of receipt of a request by the complaining Party to do so.

  1. are unable to agree to a resolution under Article 15.1 within 60 days of receipt of the

the complaining Party's request under Article 16.1; or

observe the terms of the agreement,  
  the complaining Party may at any time thereafter provide written notice to the responding
Party that it intends to suspend the application to the responding Party of benefits under this
Agreement of equivalent effect to the nullification and impairment (i) resulting from the
non-conformity or (ii) in the sense of Article 2(c). The notice shall specify the level of
benefits that the Party proposes to suspend and the basis for that level.

3. Subject to paragraph 4, 5 and 6, the complaining Party may begin suspending benefits 30
days after it provides written notice to the responding Party under paragraph 2.

4. If the responding Party considers that it has eliminated the non-conformity or the
nullification or impairment in the sense of Article 2 (c) that the panel has found, it shall
provide the complaining Party, within seven days of receipt of the complaining Party's
notice under paragraph 3, with the text of any measure taken to comply and a brief
description of how it has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment. If
the complaining Party considers that the responding Party has not eliminated the nonconformity
or the nullification or impairment, it may request the panel to reconvene under
paragraph 7 to consider the matter. The complaining Party may not suspend the application
of benefits until the panel has reconvened and issued its final report on the matter.

reasons why it considers the level of benefits proposed to be suspended manifestly
excessive. Thereafter, the responding Party may request the panel to be reconvened under
paragraph 7 to consider the matter. If the responding Party makes its request before the end
of the 30-day period referred to in paragraph 3, the complaining Party may not suspend the
application of benefits until the panel has issued its final report on the matter.

provide the complaining Party with the text of any measure taken to comply and a brief
description of how it has reduced the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment. If
the complaining Party disagrees with the responding Party's statement, it shall notify the
responding Party within 45 days of receipt of the responding Party's notification. Thereafter,
the responding Party may request the panel to be reconvened under paragraph 7 to consider
the matter. If the responding Party makes its request within seven days of receipt of the
complaining Party's notification under this paragraph, the complaining Party may not
suspend the application of benefits until the panel has issued its final report on the matter.
7. The panel shall reconvene within 14 days of the date of a request to do so under paragraph
4, 5 or 6.

which it was reconvened and the basic rationale behind any findings and determinations.
  3. The panel shall make every effort to take any decision by consensus. Nevertheless,
where a decision cannot be arrived at by consensus, the matter at issue shall be decided

agreed. No panel may, either in its interim or final report issued pursuant to paragraph 4,
5 or 6, disclose which panelists are associated with majority or minority opinions.
  4. After the panel presents to the Parties an interim report on the matter, each Party may

information, seven days after the panel presents it to the Parties.

8. If the panel has determined pursuant to paragraph 4 that the responding Party has not
eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment in the sense of Article 2
(c), the panel shall determine the level of benefits it considers to be of equivalent effect to
the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment in the sense of Article 2 (c) and
include this determination in its interim and final report.

9. If the panel pursuant to paragraph 5 or 6 determines that the level of benefits proposed to be
suspended is manifestly excessive compared to the nullification or impairment of the
benefits under this Agreement resulting from the non-conformity or from the nullification or
impairment in the sense of Article 2(c), it shall determine the level of benefits it considers to
be of equivalent effect and include this determination in its interim and final report.

10. The complaining Party might begin suspending benefits immediately after it receives the
panel's final report pursuant to paragraph 7(f), and any suspension shall be consistent with
the panel's final report.

11. Should any arbitrator of the original panel no longer be available to participate in
proceedings pursuant to this Article, a replacement shall be selected following the

1. The Party complained against shall notify the complaining Party and the {institutional
body} of the measure it has taken to comply with the ruling of the panel following the
suspension of concessions or following the application of temporary compensation, as the
case may be. With the exception of cases under paragraph 2, the complaining Party shall
terminate the suspension of concessions within 30 days from receipt of the notification. In
cases where compensation has been applied, and with the exception of cases under
paragraph 2, the defending Party may terminate the application of such compensation within

2. If the Parties do not reach an agreement on whether the notified measure brings the Party
complained against into conformity with the provisions referred to in Article 2 within 30
days of date of receipt of the notification, the complaining Party shall request in writing the
original panel to rule on the matter. Such a request shall be notified simultaneously to the
other Party and to the (institutional body). The panel ruling shall be notified to the Parties
and to the {institutional body} within 45 days of the date of the submission of the request. If
the panel rules that the measure taken to comply is in conformity with the provisions
referred to in Article 2, the suspension of obligations or compensation, as the case may be,
shall be terminated. Where relevant, the level of suspension of obligations or of
compensation shall be adapted in light of the panel ruling.]

complaining Party with the text of any measure taken to comply and a brief description of
how the responding Party has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or
impairment in the sense of Article 2(c). If the complaining Party disagrees with the
