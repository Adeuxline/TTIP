RESTREINT EU/EU RESTRICTED
Valuation
8. In estimating the value of a procurement for the purpose of ascertaining whether it is a covered
procurement, a procuring entity shall:
(a) neither divide a procurement into separate procurements nor select or use a particular
valuation method for estimating the value of a procurement with the intention of totally or
partially excluding it from the application of this [EU/GPA: Agreement] [US: Chapter]; and

whether awarded to one or more suppliers, taking into account all forms of remuneration,
including:

(ii) where the procurement provides for the possibility of options, the total value of
such options.
[EU: (iii) in the case of aggregated procurement, the maximum estimated value of all
the contracts envisaged on the basis of contractual arrangements.]
9. Where an individual requirement for a procurement results in the award of more than one
contract, or in the award of contracts in separate parts (hereinafter referred to as “recurring
contracts”), the calculation of the estimated maximum total value shall be based on:
(a) the value of recurring contracts of the same type of good or service awarded during the
preceding 12 months or the procuring entity's preceding fiscal year, adjusted, where
possible, to take into account anticipated changes in the quantity or value of the good or
service being procured over the following 12 months; or

awarded during the 12 months following the initial contract award or the procuring entity's
fiscal year.

value for its duration; or
(ii) where the term of the contract exceeds 12 months, the total estimated maximum
value including any estimated residual value;
(b) where the contract is for an indefinite period, the estimated monthly installment
multiplied by 48; and
RESTREINT EU/EU RESTRICTED
(c) where it is not certain whether the contract is to be a fixed-term contract, subparagraph

action or not disclosing any information that it considers necessary for the protection of its essential
security interests relating to the procurement of arms, ammunition, or war materials, or to
procurement indispensable for national security or for national defense purposes.]
2. Subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner that would constitute a
means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between [US: the] Parties where the same
conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on international trade, nothing in this
[EU/GPA: Agreement] [US: Chapter] shall be construed to prevent any Party from imposing or
enforcing measures:
(a) necessary to protect public morals, order or safety;

offered by that supplier for a particular procurement are goods or services of the other Party.
[EU: 3. With respect to any measure subject to each Party's law applicable to procurement applied
by public entities which qualify either as central government entities or subcentral government
entities, other than those specifically covered under Annexes X1-X2, each Party shall accord, within
the thresholds, immediately and unconditionally to the goods, services and suppliers of the other
Party, treatment no less favorable than that accorded by that Party to domestic goods, services and
suppliers.]
Use of Electronic Means
4. When conducting covered procurement by electronic means, a procuring entity shall:

planned procurement should include the subject matter of the procurement and the planned date of
the publication of the notice of intended procurement.
[EU: Preliminary Market Consultation
6. Before launching a procurement procedure, procuring entities may conduct market consultations
with a view to the preparation of the procurement and to inform economic operators of their
procurement plans and requirements. For this purpose, contracting authorities may, for example,
seek or accept advice from independent experts or authorities or from market participants which
may be used in the planning and conduct of the procurement procedure, provided that such advice
does not have the effect of distorting competition and does not result in a violation of the principles
of nondiscrimination and transparency.
7. Where a candidate or tenderer or an undertaking related to a candidate or tenderer has advised the
RESTREINT EU/EU RESTRICTED
procuring entity, or has otherwise been involved in the preparation of the procurement procedure,
the contracting authority shall take appropriate measures to ensure that competition is not distorted
by the participation of that candidate or tenderer. Such measures shall include communication to the
other candidates and tenderers of relevant information exchanged in the context of or resulting from

technical abilities to undertake the relevant procurement.
[EU: 2. Suppliers that, under the law of a Party in which they are established, are entitled to provide
a service, shall not be rejected solely on the ground that under the law of the Party in which a
procurement contract is awarded, they would be required to be either natural or legal persons.]
[US: 2. If the procuring entity of a Party covered under Section A requires a supplier of the other
Party to provide a document attesting the supplier's legal or financial capacities issued by a
competent authority of a Party or a competent authority recognized by a Party, and if the supplier is
ineligible to obtain such a document from the Party of the procuring entity:
(a) the procuring entity shall accept such a document issued by a competent authority of the
other Party or by a competent authority recognized by the other Party; or
(b) if the other Party does not issue such a document, or cannot do so within the time period
required, the procuring entity shall accept self-certification by the supplier attesting such
capacities.]
3. In establishing the conditions for participation, a procuring entity:
(a) shall not impose the condition that, in order for a supplier to participate in a procurement,
the supplier has previously been awarded one or more contracts by a procuring entity of a
given Party [EU: or that the supplier has prior experience in the territory of that Party, nor
give this any weight]; and
(b) may require relevant prior experience where essential to meet the requirements of the
procurement.
4. In assessing whether a supplier satisfies the conditions for participation, a procuring entity:
(a) shall evaluate the financial capacity and the commercial and technical abilities of a
supplier on the basis of that supplier's business activities both inside and outside the territory
of the Party of the procuring entity; and
(b) shall base its evaluation on the conditions that the procuring entity has specified in
advance in notices or tender documentation.
RESTREINT EU/EU RESTRICTED
5. Where there is supporting evidence, a Party, including its procuring entities, may exclude
supplier on grounds such as:

integrity of the supplier; or
(f) failure to pay taxes.
Article X.8: Qualification of Suppliers
Registration Systems and Qualification Procedures
1. A Party, including its procuring entities, may maintain a supplier registration system under which
interested suppliers are required to register and provide certain information.
2. Each Party shall ensure that:
(a) its procuring entities make efforts to minimize differences in their qualification
procedures; and
(b) where its procuring entities maintain registration systems, the entities make efforts to
minimize differences in their registration systems.
3. A Party, including its procuring entities, shall not adopt or apply any registration system or
qualification procedure with the purpose or the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to the
participation of suppliers of another Party in its procurement. [EU: Information on registration
systems or lists shall be easily available to interested suppliers.
4. Interested suppliers shall be able to request their registration at any time. They shall be informed
within a reasonably short period of time of the decision of the authority competent to decide on
their application for registration.
5. All requirements shall be related and proportionate to the subject matter of the contracts, taking
into account the need to ensure genuine competition. The criteria have to be identified, and they
have to be related to the subject matter and not be nondiscriminatory in nature.]
RESTREINT EU/EU RESTRICTED
Selective Tendering
6. Where a procuring entity intends to use selective tendering, the entity shall:
(a) include in the notice of intended procurement at least the information specified in Article
X.6:2 (a), (b), (f), (j), (k) and (l) and invite suppliers to submit a request for participation;
and
(b) provide, by the commencement of the time period for tendering, at least the information
in Article X.6:2 (c), (d), (e), (h) and (i) to the qualified suppliers that it notifies as specified
in Article X.10:3 (b).
7. A procuring entity shall allow all qualified suppliers to participate in a particular procurement,
unless the procuring entity states in the notice of intended procurement any limitation on the
number of suppliers that will be permitted to tender the criteria for selecting the limited number of
suppliers. [EU: In any case, the number of suppliers permitted to submit a tender shall be sufficient
to ensure competition.]
8. Where the tender documentation is not made publicly available from the date of publication of
the notice referred to in paragraph 6 (a), the procuring entity shall ensure that those documents are
made available at the same time to all qualified suppliers selected in accordance with paragraph 7.
Multi-use Lists
9. A procuring entity may maintain a multi-use list of suppliers, provided that a notice inviting
interested suppliers to apply for inclusion on the list is:
(a) published annually [US: in English and the official language of the Party of the
procuring entity if different than English;] and
(b) where published by electronic means, made available continuously
in the appropriate medium listed in Annex X.
10. The notice provided for in paragraph 9 shall include:
(a) a description of the goods or services, or categories thereof, for which the list may be
used;
(b) the conditions for participation to be satisfied by suppliers for inclusion on the list and
the methods that the procuring entity will use to verify that a supplier satisfies the
conditions;
(c) the name and address of the procuring entity and other information necessary to contact
the entity and obtain all relevant documents relating to the list;
(d) the period of validity of the list and the means for its renewal or termination, or where
the period of validity is not provided, an indication of the method by which notice will be
RESTREINT EU/EU RESTRICTED
given of the termination of use of the list; and
(e) and indication that the list may be used for procurement covered by this [EU/GPA:
Agreement] [US: Chapter].
11. Notwithstanding paragraph 9, a multi-use list will be valid for three years or less. A procuring
entity may publish the notice referred to in paragraph 9 only once at the beginning of the period of
validity of the list, provided that the notice:
(a) states the period of validity and that further notices will not be published; and
(b) is published by electronic means and is made available continuously during the period of
its validity.
12. A procuring entity shall allow suppliers to apply at any time for inclusion on a multi-use list and
shall include on the list all qualified suppliers within a reasonably short time. [EU: A procuring
entity shall ensure that also the procedure used to select suppliers from a multi-use list for the award
of the specific procurement, ensures sound and fair competition.]
13. Where a supplier that is not included on a multi-use list submits a request for participation in a
procurement based on a multi-use list and all required documents, within the time period provided
for in Article X.10:2, a procuring entity shall examine the request. The procuring entity shall not
exclude the supplier from consideration in respect of the procurement on the grounds that the entity
has insufficient time to examine the request, unless, in exceptional cases, due to the complexity of
the procurement, the entity is not able to complete the examination of the request within the time
period allowed for the submission of tenders.
[EU: Aggregated procurement
14. The term of contractual arrangements in aggregated procurement, such as framework
agreements or multiple award contracts, shall be indicated in the notice for intended procurement.
The term should be duly justified by the subject matter of the contract and not be indefinite.
15. The contract award criteria shall be specified in the notice for intended procurement. If all the
terms of contract award are not known at that time, the contract award criteria shall be
communicated subsequently to all economic operators which are party to the contractual
arrangement on the basis of which contracts will be awarded. For every contract to be awarded,
contracting authorities shall consult in writing the economic operators capable of performing the
contract. Contracts shall be awarded only between those procuring entities clearly identified for this
purpose in the call for competition and those suppliers originally party to the contractual
arrangement.]
[EU: Annexes X-2 and X-3] [US: Section B and Section C] Entities
16. A procuring entity covered under [EU: Annex X-2 or X-3] [US: Section B or C of a Party's
Schedule] may use a notice inviting suppliers to apply for inclusion on a multi-use list as a notice of
intended procurement, provided that:
RESTREINT EU/EU RESTRICTED
(a) the notice is published in accordance with paragraph 9 and includes the information
required under paragraph 10, with as much of the information required under Article X.6:2
as is available, and a statement that it constitutes a notice of intended procurement or that
only the suppliers on the multi-use list will receive further notices of procurement covered
by the multi-use list; and
(b) the entity promptly provides to suppliers that have expressed an interest in a given
procurement to the entity, sufficient information to permit them to assess their interest in the
procurement, including all remaining information required in Article X.6:2, to the extent
such information is available.
17. A procuring entity covered under [EU: Annex X-2 or X-3] [US: Section B or C of a Party's
Schedule] may allow a supplier that has applied for inclusion on a multi-use list in accordance with
paragraph 12 to tender in a given procurement, where there is sufficient time for the procuring
entity to examine whether the supplier satisfies the conditions for participation.
Information on Procuring Entity Decisions
18. A procuring entity shall promptly inform any supplier that submits a request for participation in
a procurement or application for inclusion on a multi-use list of the procuring entity's decision with
respect to the request or application.
19. Where a procuring entity rejects a supplier's request for participation in a procurement or
application for inclusion on a multi-use list, ceases to recognize a supplier as qualified, or removes a
supplier from a multi-use list, the entity shall promptly inform the supplier and, on request of the
supplier, promptly provide the supplier with a written explanation of the reasons for its decision.
Article X.9: Technical Specifications and Tender Documentation
Technical Specifications
1. A procuring entity shall not prepare, adopt or apply any technical specification or prescribe any
conformity assessment procedure with the purpose or the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to
international trade. [EU: Specifications shall promote full and open competition wherever and
should not be unduly restrictive and must be sufficiently clear and unambiguous to provide a
common basis for competition.]
2. In prescribing the technical specifications for the goods or services being procured, a procuring
entity shall, where appropriate:
(a) set out the technical specifications in terms of performance and functional requirements,
rather than design or descriptive characteristics; and
(b) base the technical specifications on international standards, [EU: and other international
reference systems, where such exist, including for commercial information technology and
cloud computing services] [US/GPA: where such exist], or otherwise, on national technical
regulations, recognized national standards or building codes.
RESTREINT EU/EU RESTRICTED
3. Where design or descriptive characteristics are used in the technical specifications, a procuring
entity should indicate, where appropriate, that it will consider tenders of equivalent goods or
services that demonstrably fulfill the requirements of the procurement by including words such as
“or equivalent” in the tender documentation.
4. A procuring entity shall not prescribe technical specifications that require or refer to a particular
trademark or trade name, patent, copyright, design, type, specific origin, producer or supplier,
unless there is no other sufficiently precise or intelligible way of describing the procurement
requirements and provided that, in such cases, the entity includes words such as “or equivalent” in
the tender documentation.
5. A procuring entity shall not seek or accept, in a manner that would have the effect of precluding
competition, advice that may be used in the preparation or adaptation of any technical specifications
for a specific procurement from a person that may have commercial interest in the procurement.
6. For greater certainty, a Party, including its procuring entities, may, in accordance with this
Article, prepare, adopt or apply technical specifications to promote
[US: (a)] the conservation of natural resources or protect the environment [US: ; or
(b) compliance with laws relating to internationally recognized labor rights, as defined in
Chapter X, Article X (Labor Chapter Definitions), in the territory in which the good is
produced or the service is performed.]
[EU: 7. When procuring entities formulate technical specifications in terms of performance or
functional requirements, including environmental or social characteristics, parameters shall be
sufficiently precise to allow tenderers to determine the subject matter of the contract and to allow
procuring entities to award the contract.
8. Where the procurement concerned refers to specific environmental or social characteristics,
procuring entities may, in the technical specifications, award criteria or contract performance
conditions, consider using detailed specifications or, if necessary, parts thereof, as defined by a
specific label existing within the EU, and in the US provided that:
(a) those specifications are appropriate to define the characteristics of supplies or services
that are the subject matter of the contract;
(b) they are based on objectively verifiable and nondiscriminatory criteria;
(c) each reference to a national or local standard, if any, shall include the words “or
equivalent”;
(d) they are accessible to all interested parties.
9. Procuring entities requiring a specific label shall accept all equivalent labels that fulfill the
requirements of the label indicated by the procuring entities. For products that do not bear the label,
procuring entities shall also accept a technical dossier of the manufacturer or other appropriate
means of proof, if the supplier had demonstrably no possibility of obtaining the specific label or
RESTREINT EU/EU RESTRICTED
equivalent label.
Test Reports and Means of Proof
10. The Parties, including their procuring entities, may require that interested suppliers provide a
test report from a conformity assessment body or a certificate issued by such a body as means of
proof of conformity with requirements or criteria set out in the technical specifications, the
evaluation criteria or any other terms or conditions.
11. Where the Parties, including their procuring entities, require the submission of certificates
drawn up by a specific conformity assessment body, certificates from equivalent conformity
assessment bodies shall also be accepted by them.
12. The Parties, including their procuring entities, shall accept other appropriate means of proof
than those referred to in paragraph 10 above, such as a technical dossier of the manufacturer where
the interested supplier has no access to the certificates or test reports referred to in paragraph 10
above, or no possibility of obtaining them within the relevant time limits, provided the lack of
access is not attributable to the supplier concerned.]
Tender Documentation
13. A procuring entity shall make available to suppliers tender documentation that includes all
information necessary [EU: and be sufficiently clear and specific to allow tenders to determine the
subject matter of the contract, as well as] to permit suppliers to prepare and submit responsive
tenders. Unless already provided in the notice of intended procurement, such documentation shall
include a complete description of:
(a) the procurement, including the nature and quantity of the goods or services to be
procured or, where the quantity is not known, the estimated quantity and any requirements to
be fulfilled, including any technical specifications, conformity assessment certification,
plans, drawings or instructional materials;
(b) any conditions for participation of suppliers, including a list of information and
documents that suppliers are required to submit in connection with the conditions for
participation;
(c) all evaluation criteria the entity will apply in the awarding of the contract [EU:
(including criteria referring to qualitative, environmental and social aspects applied in
contract award)], and, except where price is the sole criterion, the relative importance of
such criteria;
(d) where the procuring entity will conduct the procurement by electronic means, any
authentication and encryption requirements or other requirements related to the submission
of information by electronic means;
(e) where the procuring entity will hold an electronic auction, the rules, including
identification of the elements of the tender related to the evaluation criteria, on which the
auction will be conducted;
RESTREINT EU/EU RESTRICTED
(f) where there will be a public opening of tenders, the date, time and place for the opening
and, where appropriate, the persons authorized to be present;
(g) any other terms or conditions, including terms of payment and any limitation on the
means by which tenders may be submitted, such as whether on paper or by electronic
means; and
(h) any dates for the delivery of goods or the supply of services.
14. In establishing any date for the delivery of goods or the supply of services being procured, a
procuring entity shall take into account such factors as the complexity of the procurement, the
extent of subcontracting anticipated, and the realistic time required for production, destocking and
the transport of goods from the point of supply or for supply of services.
15. The evaluation criteria set out in the notice of intended procurement or tender documentation
may include, among others, price and other cost factors, quality, technical merit, environmental
characteristics and terms of delivery. [EU: When the procuring entity intends to lay down
conditions relating to the performance of the contract, these must be indicated in the tender
documentation, unless already indicated in the notice of intended procurement.]
16. A procuring entity shall promptly:
(a) [EU: offer unrestricted and full direct access free of charge by electronic means the
procurement documents from the date of publication of the notice and] [US/GPA: make
available tender documentation to] ensure that interested suppliers have sufficient time to
submit responsive tenders;
(b) provide, on request, the tender documentation to any interested supplier; and
(c) reply to any reasonable request for relevant information by any interested or participating
supplier, provided that such information does not give that supplier an advantage over other
suppliers.
Modifications
17. Where, prior to the award of a contract, a procuring entity modifies the criteria or requirements
set out in the notice of intended procurement or tender documentation provided to participating
suppliers, or amends or reissues a notice or tender documentation, it shall transmit in writing all
such modifications or amended or reissued notice or tender documentation:
(a) to all suppliers that are participating at the time of the modification, amendment or
reissuance, where such suppliers are known to the entity, and in all other cases, in the same
manner as the original information was made available; and
(b) in adequate time to allow such suppliers to modify and resubmit amended tenders, as
appropriate.
RESTREINT EU/EU RESTRICTED
Article X.10: Time Periods
General
1. A procuring entity shall, consistent with its own reasonable needs, provide sufficient time for
suppliers to prepare and submit requests for participation and responsive tenders, taking into
account such factors as:
(a) the nature and complexity of the procurement;
(b) the extent of subcontracting anticipated; and
(c) the time necessary for transmitting tenders by non-electronic means from foreign as well
as domestic points where electronic means are not used.

the procuring entity renders this time period impracticable, the time period may be reduced to not
less than 10 days.
3. Except as provided for in paragraphs 4, 5, 7 and 8, a procuring entity shall establish that the final
date for the submission of tenders shall not be less than 40 days from the date on which:

paragraph 3 by five days for each one of the following circumstances:
(a) the notice of intended procurement is published by electronic means;
(b) all the tender documentation is made available by electronic means from the date of the
publication of the notice of intended procurement; and
(c) the entity accepts tenders by electronic means.
6. The use of paragraph 5, in conjunction with paragraph 4, shall in no case result in the reduction
of the time period for tendering [EU: set out in] [US/GPA: established in accordance with]
paragraph 3 to less than 10 days from the date on which the notice of intended procurement is
published.
7. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Article, where a procuring entity purchases
commercial goods or services, or any combination thereof, it may reduce the time period for
tendering established in accordance with paragraph 3 to not less than 13 days, provided that it
publishes by electronic means, at the same time, both the notice of intended procurement and the
tender documentation. In addition, where the entity accepts tenders for commercial goods or
services by electronic means, it may reduce the time period established in accordance with
paragraph 3 to not less than 10 days.
8. Where a procuring entity covered under [EU: Annex X-2 or X-3] [US: Annex X Section B or C]
has selected all or a limited number of qualified suppliers, the time period for tendering may be
fixed by mutual agreement between the procuring entity and the selected suppliers. In the absence
of agreement, the period shall not be less than 10 days.
Article X.11: Negotiation
1. A Party may provide for its procuring entities to conduct negotiations:
(a) where the entity has indicated its intent to conduct negotiations in the notice of intended
procurement required under Article X.6:2; or
RESTREINT EU/EU RESTRICTED

Article X.12: Limited Tendering
1. Provided that it does not use this provision for the purpose of avoiding competition among
suppliers or in a manner that discriminates against suppliers of the other Party or protects domestic
suppliers, a procuring entity may use limited tendering and may choose not to apply [Article X.6
through X.8, X.9 (paragraphs 13 through 17), X.10, X.11, X.13 and X.14] only under any of the
following circumstances:
(a) where:
(i) no tenders were submitted or no suppliers requested participation;
(ii) no tenders that conform to the essential requirements of the tender documentation
were submitted;
(iii) no suppliers satisfied the conditions for participation; or
(iv) the tenders submitted have been collusive;

services:
RESTREINT EU/EU RESTRICTED
(i) cannot be made for economic or technical reasons such as requirements of
interchangeability or interoperability with existing equipment, software, services, or
installations procured under the initial procurement; and
(ii) would cause significant inconvenience or substantial duplication of costs for the
procuring entity;
(d) insofar as is strictly necessary where, for reasons of extreme urgency brought about by
events unforeseeable by the procuring entity, the goods or services could not be obtained in
time using open tendering or selective tendering;
(e) for goods purchased on a commodity market;
(f) where a procuring entity procures a prototype or a first good or service that is developed
at its request in the course of, and for, a particular contract for research, experiment, study or
original development. Original development of a first good or service may include limited
production or supply in order to incorporate the results of field testing and to demonstrate
that the good or service is suitable for production or supply in quantity to acceptable quality
standards, but does not include quantity production or supply to establish commercial
viability or to recover research and development costs;
(g) for purchases made under exceptionally advantageous conditions that only arise in the
very short term in the case of unusual disposals such as those arising from liquidation,
receivership, or bankruptcy, but not for routine purchases from regular suppliers; or
(h) where a contract is awarded to a winner of a design contest provided that:
(i) the contest has been organized in a manner that is consistent with the principles of
this Chapter, in particular relating to the publication of a notice of intended

Article X.14: Treatment of Tenders and Awarding of Contracts
Treatment of Tenders
1. A procuring entity shall receive, open and treat all tenders under processes that guarantee the
fairness and impartiality of the procurement process, and the confidentiality of tenders.
2. A procuring entity shall not penalize any supplier whose tender is received after the time
specified for receiving tenders if the delay is due solely to mishandling on the part of the procuring
entity.
3. Where a procuring entity provides a supplier with an opportunity to correct unintentional errors
of form between the opening of tenders and the awarding of the contract, the procuring entity shall
provide the same opportunity to all participating suppliers.
Awarding of Contracts
4. To be considered for an award, a tender shall be submitted in writing and shall, at the time of
opening, comply with the essential requirements set out in the notices and tender documentation
and be from a supplier that satisfies the conditions for participation.
5. Unless a procuring entity determines that it is not in the public interest to award a contract, the
entity shall award the contract to the supplier that the entity has determined to be capable of
fulfilling the terms of the contract and that, based solely on the evaluation criteria specified in the
notices and tender documentation, has submitted:
(a) the most [EU: economically] advantageous tender; or
(b) where price is the sole criterion, the lowest price.
6. Where a procuring entity receives a tender with a price that is abnormally lower than the prices in
other tenders submitted, it may verify with the supplier that it satisfies the conditions for
participation and is capable of fulfilling the terms of the contract.
7. A procuring entity shall not use options, cancel a procurement, or modify awarded contracts in a
manner that circumvents the obligations under this [EU/GPA: Agreement] [US: Chapter].
[EU: 8. Each Party shall ensure that its procuring entities are aware of the respective merits of
choosing the most economically advantageous tender or the lowest price, taking into account the
principle of best value for money.
9. The contracting authority shall specify in the procurement documents the relative weighting
which is given to each of the criteria chosen to determine the most economically advantageous
RESTREINT EU/EU RESTRICTED
tender, except where this is identified on the basis of price alone.
10. Evaluation criteria can refer to qualitative, environmental and social aspects linked to the
subject matter of the public contract in question.
11. Where a procuring entity establishes that a tender is abnormally low because it does not comply
with environmental, social and labor law, or because the supplier has obtained subsidies, the tender
can be rejected on that ground alone only after consultations with the supplier where the latter is
unable to prove, within a sufficient time fixed by the procuring entity, that the evidence supplied
does not satisfactorily account for the low level of price proposed or that the subsidy in question
was granted in compliance with the disciplines relating to subsidies laid down in this Agreement.
12. Procuring entities may lay down conditions relating to the performance of a contract, provided
that they are linked to the subject matter of the contract and indicated in the notice of intended
procurement or in the tender documentation. These conditions may include economic, innovationrelated,
environmental or social considerations.
13. After the award decision has been communicated to participating suppliers pursuant to Article
X.15:1, a procuring entity shall not conclude the contract before the expiry of a period of time that
shall be not less than 10 days from the date the information award decision has reached the
participating suppliers or reasonably should have become known to the participating suppliers.
14. In case an interested or participating supplier has submitted a challenge with the competent
authority referred to in Article X.17:4 and X.17:6, a procuring entity shall not conclude the contract
until that authority has taken a decision or recommendation on the challenge, either with regards to
interim measures or corrective action as referred to in Article X.17:8 and X.17:9.]
Article X.15: Transparency of Procurement Information
Information Provided to Suppliers
1. A procuring entity shall promptly inform participating suppliers of the entity's contract award
decisions and, on the request of a supplier, shall do so in writing. Subject to paragraphs 2 and 3 of
Article X.16, a procuring entity shall, on request, provide an unsuccessful supplier with an
explanation of the reasons why the entity did not select its tender and the relative advantages of the
successful supplier's tender.
Publication of Award Information
2. Not later than 72 days after the award of each contract covered by this Chapter, a procuring entity
shall publish a notice in [US: English and the official language of the Party of the procuring entity if
different than English and in] the appropriate paper or electronic medium listed in Annex X. Where
the entity publishes the notice only in an electronic medium, the information shall remain readily
accessible for a reasonable period of time. The notice shall include at least the following
information:

relevant to the procurement covered by this Chapter. In this context, the Parties should seek to
develop a common method for the collection of statistics and standardization of classification in the
statistical data.]
[US: 4. The Parties shall endeavor to cooperate on issues relating to the sharing of data required by
the revised GPA. This includes work undertaken in the revised GPA Work Program on the
Collection and Reporting of Statistical Data.]
Article X.16: Disclosure of Information
Provision of Information to Parties
1. On request of the other Party, a Party shall provide promptly any information necessary to
determine whether a procurement was conducted fairly, impartially, and in accordance with this
[EU/GPA: Agreement] [US: Chapter], including information on the characteristics and relative
advantages of the successful tender. In cases where release of the information would prejudice
competition in future tenders, the Party that receives the information shall not disclose it to any
supplier, except after consulting with, and obtaining the agreement of, the Party that provided the
information.
RESTREINT EU/EU RESTRICTED
Non-Disclosure of Information
2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Chapter, a Party, including its procuring entities,
shall not provide to any particular supplier information that might prejudice fair competition
between suppliers.

protection of intellectual property; or
(d) would otherwise be contrary to the public interest.]
Article X.17: Domestic Review Procedures
1. Each Party shall provide a timely, effective, transparent and non-discriminatory administrative or
judicial review procedure through which a supplier may challenge:
{a} a breach of the Chapter; or
(b) where the supplier does not have a right to challenge directly a breach of the Chapter
under the domestic law of a Party, a failure to comply with a Party's measures implementing
this Chapter,
arising in the context of a covered procurement, in which the supplier has, or has had, an interest
[EU: and who has been or risks being harmed by an alleged breach.] The procedural rules for all
challenges shall be in writing and made generally available.
[EU: 2. The Parties shall ensure that upon a challenge by a supplier, the review body can examine
decisions taken by their respective procuring entities on whether a particular procurement falls
under the scope of this Chapter.]
3. In the event of a complaint by a supplier [EU: alleging a breach or a failure as referred to in
paragraph 1 and] arising in the context of covered procurement in which the supplier has, or has
had, an interest [EU: and who has been harmed by an alleged breach] [US/GPA: and where there
has been a breach or a failure as referred to in paragraph 1], the Party of the procuring entity
conducting the procurement shall encourage the entity and the supplier to seek resolution of the
complaint through consultations. The entity shall accord impartial and timely consideration to any
such complaint in a manner that is not prejudicial to the supplier's participation in ongoing or future
procurement or its right to seek corrective measures under the administrative or judicial review
procedure.
[EU: 4. Parties should make information on the review system available. Each supplier shall be
RESTREINT EU/EU RESTRICTED
communicated the relevant information on the basis of which an appeal can be filed and the
instance where it can be filed. Each supplier should also be allowed a sufficient period of time to
prepare and submit a challenge, which in no case shall be less than 10 days from the time when the
basis of the challenge became known or reasonably should have become known to the supplier.]
[US/GPA: 4. Each supplier shall be allowed a sufficient period of time to prepare and submit a
challenge, which in no case shall be less than 10 days from the time when the basis of the challenge

5. Each Party shall establish or designate at least one impartial administrative or judicial authority
that is independent of its procuring entities to receive and review a challenge by a supplier arising in
the context of a covered procurement. [EU: All steps of procedure shall be subject to the domestic
review system.
Where an impartial administrative authority is designated by a Party, the Party shall ensure that:
(a) the members are appointed and leave office under the same conditions as members of
judicial authorities as regards the authority responsible for their appointment, their period of
office, and their removal;
(b) at least the President of this impartial administrative authority has the same legal and
professional qualifications as members of judicial authorities.]
6. Where a body other than an authority referred to in paragraph 5 initially reviews a challenge, the
Party shall ensure that the supplier may appeal the initial decision to an impartial administrative or
judicial authority that is independent of the procuring entity whose procurement is the subject of the
challenge.
7. Each Party shall ensure that a review body that is not a court shall have its decision subject to
judicial review or have procedures that provide that:

other document relating to the tendering procedure, and in the case of Annex X-3's
entities, adopting any other measures with the aim of remedying the breach to this
Chapter, in particular in order to pay a particular sum as long as the breach has not
been remedied;
(ii) where a contract has been concluded by a procuring entity, the contract declared
ineffective.
10. Where a contract has already been concluded for cases other than those provided for in
paragraph 9, the Parties may provide that measures provided in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) are not
available: compensation for the loss or damages suffered.
11. A contract shall be declared ineffective pursuant to paragraph 9 (ii) in any of the following
cases:
(a) the procuring entity has awarded the contract pursuant to a limited tendering without this
being permissible under the provisions of Article X.12;
(b) where the procuring entity has concluded a contract without observing the mandatory
standstill periods referred to in paragraph 9, such a violation has prevented the interested
RESTREINT EU/EU RESTRICTED
supplier from submitting a challenge before the conclusion of the contract, and the review
body has found a breach of this Chapter other than such violation of the standstill period.
12. Each Party may provide that the review body may decide that ineffectiveness does not apply if
the review authority finds that overriding reasons relating to a general interest require that the
effects of the contract should be maintained.

be effectively enforced.]
Article X.18: Modifications and Rectifications to Coverage
[EU: Notification of Proposed Modifications
1. A Party shall notify the other Party of any proposed rectification, transfer of an entity from one
Annex to another, withdrawal of an entity, or other modification (referred to in this Article as
“modification”) of Annexes X-1 through X-7.
2, For any proposed withdrawal of an entity from Appendix 1 in exercise of its rights on the
grounds that government control or influence over it has been effectively eliminated, the Party
proposing the modification (“modifying Party”) shall include in the notification evidence that such
government control or influence has been effectively eliminated.
3. The other Party shall not be entitled to compensatory adjustments if government control and
influence over the entity's covered procurement have been effectively eliminated.
4. For any other proposed modification, the modifying Party shall include in the notification
information on the likely consequences of the change for the mutually agreed coverage provided in
the Agreement. Where the modifying Party proposes to make minor amendments or technical
rectifications of a purely formal nature not affecting covered procurement, modifications of this
kind shall be notified at least every two years.
Resolution of Objection
5. In case of objection by the other Party (“objecting Party”) to the notification by the modifying
Party, the Parties shall seek to resolve the objection through bilateral consultations. In such
consultations, the Parties shall consider:
(a) evidence pertaining to the effective elimination of government control or influence over
an entity's covered procurement in the case of a notification under paragraph 2;
(b) evidence that the proposed modification does not affect coverage in the case of a
notification under paragraph 3; and
(c) any claims, relating to the need for or level of compensatory adjustments, arising from
modifications notified according to paragraph 1. The adjustments may consist of either
compensatory expansion of coverage by the modifying Party or a withdrawal of equivalent
coverage by the objecting Party, with a view to maintaining a balance of rights and
RESTREINT EU/EU RESTRICTED
obligations and a comparable level of mutually agreed coverage provided in this Chapter.
6. Where the objecting Party considers that, after bilateral consultations under paragraph 5:
(a) in the case of paragraph 5 (a), government control or influence over an entity's covered
procurement has not been effectively eliminated;
(b) in the case of paragraph 5 (b), a modification does not meet the criteria in paragraph 3
and which affects coverage, and should be subject to compensatory adjustments; and/or
(c) in the case of paragraph 5 (c), compensatory adjustments proposed during the
consultation between the Parties is not adequate to maintain a comparable level of mutually
agreed coverage,
the Parties may use the dispute settlement mechanism under the Chapter of the Agreement.
Implementation
7. A proposed modification shall become effective only where:
(a) the other Party has not submitted to the modifying party a written objection to the
proposed modification within 45 days from the date of the notification of the proposed
modifications;
(b) the Parties have reached an agreement after due consultations under paragraph 6; or
(c) the objection has been resolved through the dispute settlement mechanism under
paragraph 6.]
[US: 1. A Party may make rectifications of a purely formal nature to its coverage under this
Chapter, or minor amendments to its Schedules in Annex X, provided that it notifies the other Party
in writing and the other Party does not object in writing within 30 days of the notification. A Party
that makes such a rectification or minor amendment need not provide compensatory adjustments to
the other Party.
2. A Party may otherwise modify its coverage under this Chapter provided that the Party:
(a) notifies the other Party in writing and the other Party does not object in writing within 30
days of the notification; and
(b) offers, within 30 days of the notification, acceptable compensatory adjustments to the
other Party to maintain a level of coverage comparable to the level of coverage that would
exist if the modification is not made.
3. A notification under paragraph 2 shall include:
(a) for any proposed withdrawal of an entity from Annex X on the grounds that government
control or influence over the entity's covered procurement has been effectively eliminated,
RESTREINT EU/EU RESTRICTED
evidence that such government control or influence has been effectively eliminated; or
(b) for any other proposed modification, an explanation of the reason for the proposed
modification and information on how the proposed modification is likely to affect benefits
accruing to the other Party under this Chapter.
4. A Party need not provide compensatory adjustments in those circumstances where the Parties
agree that the proposed modification covers a procuring entity over which a Party has effectively
eliminated its control or influence. Where a Party objects to the assertion that such government
control or influence has been effectively eliminated, the objecting Party may request further
information or consultations with a view to clarifying the nature of any government control or
influence and reaching agreement on the procuring entity's continued coverage under this Chapter.
5. The Parties shall seek to resolve any objections to a proposed modification through
consultations.2 In such consultations, the Parties shall consider the proposed modification and, in
the case of notification described in paragraph 3 (b), any claim for compensatory adjustments, with
a view to maintaining a balance of rights and obligations and a level of mutually agreed coverage
comparable to the level that would exist under this Chapter if the modification is not made.
6. The […] shall modify Annex X to reflect any rectifications or modifications made pursuant to
this Article.]
