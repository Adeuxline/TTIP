## CONSOLIDATED PROPOSALS  

## CHAPTER X  
## SANITARY AND PHYTOSANITARY MEASURES

*[Note: Consistent with the recommendations of the US-EU High Level Working Group Report on
Jobs and Growth, the Parties seek to establish an “SPS-plus” chapter that builds upon the key
principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO) SPS Agreement, including with respect to
science, while preserving each Party's ability to achieving its appropriate level of protection as it
relates to human, animal or plant life or health.]*

### [EU: Objectives

### The objectives of this chapter are to:

1. Facilitate trade between the Parties to the greatest extent possible while preserving each Party's
right to protect human, animal or plant life and health in its territory and respecting each Party's
regulatory systems, risk assessment, risk management and policy development processes;
2. Ensure that the Parties' sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures do not create unnecessary
barriers to trade;
3. Further the implementation of the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and
Phytosanitary Measures (WTO SPS Agreement);
4. Build upon and extend the scope of the Veterinary Agreement which is fully integrated in this
Chapter;
5. Improve communication and cooperation on sanitary and phytosanitary measures between the
Parties;
6. Improve consistency, predictability and transparency of each Party's SPS measures;
7. Provide a framework for dialogue and cooperation with a view to enhancing the protection and
welfare of animals and reaching a common understanding concerning animal welfare standards

### Article X.1: Scope [and Coverage]

This Chapter [US: , unless otherwise specified,] applies to all SPS measures that may, directly or
indirectly, affect trade between Parties.
[EU: This Chapter shall also apply to collaboration on animal welfare matters.]

### Article X.2 [EU: Rights and Obligations / ] Affirmation of the SPS Agreement

The Parties affirm their rights and obligations [US: with respect to each other] under the [WTO]
SPS Agreement.

[EU: Nothing in this Chapter shall limit the rights or obligations of the Parties under the Agreement
established by the World Trade Organization and its Annexes.

The Parties shall avail themselves of the necessary resources to effectively implement this Chapter.]

### Article X.3: Competent Authorities [US: and Contact Points]

[EU: For the purpose of this Chapter, the competent authorities of each Party are those listed in
{Annex 2}. The Parties shall inform each other of any change of these competent authorities.]
[US: Upon entry into force of this Agreement, each Party shall provide the other Party with the
following information in writing:
1. with respect to each of the Parties' competent authorities that have responsibility for
developing, implementing, and enforcing SPS measures that may affect trade between the
Parties;
  1. a description of each authority, including the authority's specific responsibilities,
and
  2. a point of contact within each authority; and
2. the name and contact information for a representative of the Party with authority to
accept correspondence or inquiries from the other Party regarding matters arising under this
Chapter.

Each Party shall promptly transmit to the other Party any material changes to this information.]

### Article X.4: Equivalence
[EU: 1. The importing Party shall accept sanitary and phytosanitary measures of the exporting Party
as equivalent to its own if the exporting Party objectively demonstrates to the importing Party that
its measures achieve the importing Party's appropriate level of protection.]

[EU: 2. Equivalence may be recognized in relation to an individual measure and/or groups of
measures and/or systems applicable to a sector or part of a sector. For the determination, recognition
and maintenance of equivalence the Parties shall follow the principles set out in the available
guidance of international standard-setting bodies1 recognized by the WTO SPS Agreement, as well
as in the provisions of {Annex IV}, where applicable.]

[US: 1. Each Party recognizes that determining that SPS measures of the other Party achieve an
equivalent level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection as its own SPS measures can facilitate trade
between the Parties. Each Party shall permit such determinations of equivalence to be made with
respect to a specific measure, on the basis of a product or category of products or on a system-wide
basis.
2. Each Party, in determining whether an SPS measure of the other Party achieves the Party's
appropriate level of protection, shall take into account the following, where relevant:
  1. decisions of the WTO SPS Committee;
  2. the work of the relevant international organizations; and
  3. knowledge acquired through experience with the other Party's relevant competent
authorities.
3. Each Party shall follow the process set forth in Annex X-A with respect to determinations of
equivalence.]
[EU: 3. The final determination whether a sanitary measure maintained by an exporting Party
achieves the importing Party's appropriate level of sanitary protection rests solely with the
importing Party acting in accordance with its administrative and legislative framework.
4. Where the importing Party has concluded a positive equivalence determination, the importing
Party shall take the necessary legislative and/or administrative measures to implement it without
undue delay and normally within six months.
5. If necessary and objectively justified, the Parties may identify special conditions which, in
combination with the exporting Party's measures, will achieve the importing Party's appropriate
level of protection.
6. {Annex V} sets out:
  1. The areas for which the importing Party recognizes that the measures of the exporting
Party are equivalent to its own, and
  2. The areas for which the importing Party recognizes that the fulfillment of the specified
special conditions, combined with the exporting Party's measures, achieve the importing
Party's appropriate level of protection.
7. The Parties may agree on simplified sanitary or phytosanitary certificates for products for which
equivalence has been recognized.]
